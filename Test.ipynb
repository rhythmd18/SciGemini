They move faster when they are closer to the Sun and slower when they are farther from the Sun.\\n- The orbital periods of the planets are related to the sizes of their orbits. Planets with larger orbits have longer orbital periods.\\n\\n**Significance of Kepler's Laws**\\n\\nKepler's laws were a major breakthrough in astronomy. They provided the first accurate description of the motion of the planets.

      "1. **Law of Orbits:**\n",
      "   - Each planet's orbit around the Sun is an ellipse, with the Sun located at one of the foci.\n",
      "   - An ellipse is a two-dimensional shape with two focal points. The eccentricity of an ellipse determines how elongated it is, with a value between 0 and 1. A circle is a special case of an ellipse with an eccentricity of 0.\n",

      "2. **Law of Areas:**\n",
      "   - A line connecting a planet to the Sun sweeps out equal areas in equal time intervals.\n",
      "   - This law implies that a planet's speed varies as it moves around its elliptical orbit. It is fastest when closest to the Sun (perihelion) and slowest when farthest from the Sun (aphelion).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Law of Periods:**\n",
      "   - The square of a planet's orbital period (the time it takes to complete one orbit) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit.\n",
      "   - Mathematically, this can be expressed as: $ (T^2 = k \times a^3) $, where T is the orbital period, a is the semi-major axis (half the longest diameter of the ellipse), and k is a constant\n",
